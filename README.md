# Compile Time Polymorphism Example
Polymorphism provides an ability for the classes to implement different methods that are called through the same name and it also provides an ability to invoke the methods of a derived class through base class reference during runtime based on our requirements.

Compile Time Polymorphism means defining multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters. By using compile-time polymorphism, we can perform different tasks with the same method name by passing different parameters.
